# AdoptAFurryFriend :dog:

## Description of Site
"Adopt a Furry Friend" is a Node.js application to help those in the Bay Area find their new best friend (doge)! 

The site was built with data (dog information) scraped from three dog adoption agency sites in the Bay Area (Petsmart, Rocket Dog Rescue, and Humane Society of Silicon Valley) using Cheerio (node package).
